# Dupont-Diaries-A-Resident-Timeline-of-1807-Dupont-Ave-S
This project reconstructs a detailed year-by-year timeline of individuals residing at 1807 Dupont Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55403 using digitized Minneapolis city directories. 

# 🏛️ Historical Resident Timeline Reconstruction for 1807 Dupont Ave S, Minneapolis (1902–1950)

This project aims to create a detailed **year-by-year timeline** of residents living at **1807 Dupont Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55403**, using **digitized Minneapolis city directories** and advanced AI tools.

The project demonstrates how AI (OCR + LLM) can power the reconstruction of a property's history — a key vision of platforms like HouseNovel.

## 🧠 Project Overview

### 🎯 Objective

To compile a structured, year-wise timeline (1902–1950) of residents for the Minneapolis address `1807 Dupont Ave S` by:

- Extracting relevant resident entries from city directories
- Parsing names, occupations, employers, and spouses
- Matching address variations and inconsistencies
- Validating with image and text cross-references

---

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

### 📌 Phase 1: Data Collection & Structuring

1. **Image Tile Download & Assembly**
   - Downloaded 6 tiles per page from the Hennepin County archive.
   - Stitched into a single full-page image using OpenCV.

2. **OCR Text Extraction**
   - Applied `EasyOCR` to extract text and bounding boxes.
   - Saved output images with bounding boxes annotated.
   - Stored raw text for each page.

3. **Text Correction (Gemini)**
   - Cleaned raw OCR output using Gemini 1.5.
   - Removed common OCR errors, restored formatting and names.

4. **Structured Data Extraction (Gemini)**
   - Prompted Gemini to extract the following fields into structured JSON:
     - `First_Name`, `Last_Name`
     - `Spouse_Name`
     - `Occupation`
     - `Employer_Business_Name_Address`
     - `Home_Address`

5. **File Organization**
   - Each year has its own folder with:
     - Page image
     - Annotated OCR output
     - Raw text file
     - Structured JSON

🔗 All output files are available here:  
**Google Drive Folder:**

### 📌 Phase 2: Timeline Construction – 1807 Dupont Ave S

1. **Address Normalization**
   - Used regex to match address variants:
     - "1807 Dupont Ave S"
     - "1807 Dupont Av S"
     - "1807 Dupont Avenue South"
     - "1807 Dupont av."

2. **Matching Structured Entries**
   - Filtered JSON outputs year-wise to identify matching records.

3. **Timeline Assembly**
   - Compiled all matching records in chronological order (1902–1950).
   - Displayed:
     - Full name
     - Spouse name (if any)
     - Occupation
     - Employer or Business Address

4. **Validation & Cross-Checking**
   - Compared structured data with:
     - Raw OCR text
     - Annotated page images
   - Manually corrected names, formatting issues, and partial matches.
